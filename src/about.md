# About me

I've been programming for a large part of my life.
Since I was about 10 or 11 years old in fact.
It started with animated PowerPoint slides, progressing into batch scripts on Windows, then some adventures in C++ before I landed in C# and Lua as my main languages.

I don’t remember how I ended up with C#, but since my platform at the time was Windows and I had started using Visual Studio for my C++ code, C# was close at hand.
The reason for learning Lua was much simpler: World of Warcraft.
Since the game uses Lua for its AddOn API, I started learning it when I wanted to add functionality to the game.

My very first (at least first *real*) AddOn for WoW was [Chocobo][chocobo-cf].
A friend wanted chocobo music from Final Fantasy to play when they used certain mounts in the game reminiscent of the chocobos, so I made it reality!

On the C# side, I was doing mostly utility things and homework-style projects from the book &quot;Head First C#&quot;.
Some of the projects can be found on [my GitHub profile][github-profile], but others have sadly been lost, as I did not utilize any version control software in the very beginnings.

I continued to maintain my programming interest throughout my early life and into higher education. Beginning with an engineering programme at high school and then pursuing a computer science degree at university.

## Present day

Today I work professionally as a programmer, living the dream as it were.
Currently doing C# work at [Ninetech][] as a Systems Developer.
A job I managed to secure straight out of university, in large thanks to the mentoring programme at Karlstad University.

C# is probably the language I’m most passionate about, closely followed by Ruby.
But I enjoy trying out various different languages and technologies!

I also maintain a bunch of hobby projects on my free time, including this personal website.
Other notable hobby projects include&hellip;

### [Colore][github-colore]

> A powerful and elegant C# library for Razer Chroma’s SDK.

Essentially a wrapper around Razer’s own C++ SDK for their Chroma APIs. Designed to be familiar and friendly to C# developers, taking care of all nasty native code shenanigans and presenting an API designed for use in the .NET ecosystem.

### [cshrix][github-cshrix] & [cshrix-bot][github-cshrix-bot]

Work-in-progress [library][github-cshrix] and [bot][github-cshrix-bot] for the [Matrix protocol][matrix].
Made with C# targeting .NET Standard.

Sort of a successor to my earlier projects [chatrix][github-chatrix] and [chatrix-bot][github-chatrix-bot].

### [klox][github-klox]

A Kotlin implementation of the Lox programming language.
This project was made following the excellent book [“Crafting Interpreters”][crafting-interpreters] by Bob Nystrom.

### [Advent of Code solutions][github-aoc]

I maintain a [repository on GitHub][github-aoc] for my solutions to the [Advent of Code][aoc] annual event.
I do them in a variety of languages, but mainly scripting/dynamic languages as they tend to be quicker to write solutions in.
