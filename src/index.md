# Hi, I’m Adam!

You may be more familiar with my online nickname: **Sharparam**.

I enjoy programming, which I started doing as a kid in circa 2005, and have done professionally since 2017.
I host most of my work at [GitHub][github-sharparam].

Other interests of mine include photography and playing the piano.

If you’d like to read more about me, check out the [about](/about) page.

Want to get in touch? Check out [the contact page](/contact) for information on how to reach me.

*Maybe one day I’ll start writing a blog again…*
